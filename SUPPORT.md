# Getting support for Konfigyr Plugins

### GitHub issues
We choose not to use GitHub issues for general usage questions and support, preferring to
use issues solely for the tracking of bugs and enhancements. If you have a general
usage question please do not open a GitHub issue, but use one of the other channels
described below.

If you are reporting a bug, please help to speed up problem diagnosis by providing as
much information as possible. Ideally, that would include a small sample project that
reproduces the problem.

### Gitter
If you want to discuss something or have a question, the Konfigyr Plugin community chat in the [#konfigyr-plugin room on Gitter](https://gitter.im/konfigyr/konfigyr-plugin).
